# MechaChar_Statistical_Analysis

## Study Design: Mechacar Competition

###### What metric or metrics are you going to test?
we will be testing MechaCar vs the competitor to find the best metrics and best consumerism that is enviromentally friendly and offers durability, reliability, best pricing and recyclability when the car is done servicing
###### What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
the null hypothesis for the environmentally friendly measure proves that the MechaCar is not any greener than the competitor based on the selected green criterias
###### What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
The statistical testings performed determine how green the Mechacar is vs the competitor. Linear regression measures both simple and mutliple. If different models of Mechacars were to be used, chi-squared test would be utilized because it requires categorical data.
###### What data is needed to run the statistical test?
CO2 emmisions, efficiency in the highway vs city, material used to build the car.
